    <h2>Research on Self-Acceptence and Self-Worth</h2>
    <p>For my final project, I will be addressing the importance of self-appreciation, how it can affect a person’s daily life, How problems with self-appreciation can originate, and possible ways to improve a person’s level of self-acceptance. At the moment, I am envisioning a narrative experience. To accomplish this, I need to focus on how a lack of self-appreciation can originate and spiral out of their own control. This phenomenon of a lack of self-worth is referred to as shame, and according to Mario Jacoby in his book Shame and the Origins of Self-Esteem: a Jungian Approach, it starts in a person’s early developing years. According to Jacoby, a person’s views of self-worth are forged in the first relationships they have in their life, typically with their parents or other family members. If a child isn’t raised knowing they are valued early on, it can cause serious psychological problems later on in their life dealing with self-worth (Jacoby 16).</p>
    <p>In the Psychology Today article “The Importance of Self-Love,” author Beverly Flaxington addresses what self-love means and why it matters. “Loving one’s self does not mean developing a shell and blocking out the world. [...] It does mean becoming comfortable with who you are” (Flaxington). Flaxington goes on to state that a dead sense of self-loathing can hurt the people are you as well, as they struggle to find acceptance causes some people to lash out at those who already have a sense of self-worth. One of Flaxington’s main ways of helping people cultivate their own sense of self-worth is by realizing that “each person does what they are capable of on their own evolution and journey.” This is one of the most important points, as it alludes to the fact that a lack of self-acceptance can lead people to a misunderstanding of how other people live their lives. An unhappy person might not understand the experiences of someone who has known unconditional love their entire lives. This misunderstanding can lead to conflict, which affects everyone involved.</p>
    <p>Flaxington goes on to say that this lack of self-worth can come from people who have only experience conditional love. Flazington states, “...the love they get is based on actions—being a “good girl” or “good boy”—or it is given out sporadically when the parent, guardian, or adult in the picture feels like being magnanimous.” When someone has only experienced conditional love, they believe that their worth is only based on their actions or achievements. What these people fail to realize is that a person’s worth is unconditional and that everyone is born with inherent value that is not based on their actions. This is the main lesson I hope to teach in my final project, that all human beings matter regardless of who they are. Once people realize they matter for just being themself, it will be easier for them to see the value in everyone else.</p>
