        <h2>Website 1: <a href="https://lycanthrop.fr/">Lycanthrop.fr</a></h2>
        <img src="images/lycan.jpg" title= "lycanthrop.fr screen capture">
        <p>The first website is a portfolio website for a French web agency. The way it displays information across its single page is very intriguing, and each of its sections has different levels of interaction. The color choice is also very pleasing and flows nicely which background pictures and other elements on the page.</p>
        <p>The form to contact them at the bottom seems to be the only form of collecting data they have, but even that is displayed in an interesting way. Every link on the page has a different hover over interaction; some rise slightly others change their background color. And all of these animations have a short transition time that gives an interesting effect.</p>
        <p>The content is sectioned into different parts of the same page, each with a unique color and title. These sections don’t have enough content to justify a completely separate page, so keeping everything on one page is a smart choice. Still, there are links on the top of the page that scroll users to lower sections, which is an interesting effect.</p>
        <p>However, there is a small lack of clarity on what is an actual link and what isn’t. A lot of the animations on the page animate in some way, but not all of these elements are clickable. This could potentially confuse some users, as they might actually be less likely to click around the page to try if everything is a link if everything looks like one. The map at the bottom of the page, for example, has no level of interaction when you mouse over it, but is an actual link to google maps, which is not obvious.</p>

        <h2>Website 2: <a href="https://craftwork.design/">CraftWork.design</a></h2>
        <img src="images/craftwork.png" title= "craftwork.design screen capture">
        <p>The second website is a site for illustration asset distribution. What caught my attention from this website is how the illustration works seamlessly with the other site elements, and have a color scheme that matches perfectly. It creates a page that is fun to explore and immediately inviting. I would like to incorporate this idea into my final project.</p>
        <p>The content is sectioned well, has some of the extra information in boxes on the right. This also works surprisingly well on mobile. Links are obvious and well organized, each of them having a small transparency effect to show they are clickable. Sectioning off different pages on the top seems like a well thought out idea. The most important links are clear right at the front of the page; links to try or purchase the product are the easiest to see. </p>
        <p>There is also a form that is displayed in an interesting way. In the bottom right corner of the screen that is a pop up that opens into an instant message style box. There, you can contact the owners in a fun, unique way. It is a smart way to have a contact us menu that looks very unique.</p>
